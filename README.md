# phpQS
A PHP version of the .NET Quality Souvenirs Website for Web Application Development at Unitec.

For this Assignment, the task was to create a simple E-Commerce Website using PHP and Laravel. 
The User's are able to a register, add to cart and checkout items from the store.
There are are also predefined admin user's that are able to create, update or delete item listing.
They can also check and manage user order's aswell. 

## Built With
- [Laravel 5.2.0](https://laravel.com/)
- [Composer for PHP](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) - for local deployment and testing. 
- Using PHPStorm IDE
- Node Modules are listed in the package.json file

## Live Demo

Since this was a project I did while at Unitec: Here is a [Live Demo](http://dochyper.unitec.ac.nz/achars05/php_assignment/public/index.php/)
> Since, As of 22/11/19; it is still live but I'm not sure if and when it will go down.
> Though it does seem to have some issues. 

### Notes
- A User and Admin cannot be logged in at the same time. 
- An Admin cannot login via the User's Login Interface as there are seperate databases to track the users.
> I wouldn't say it's completed and polished as this was my first time ever using PHP, Laravel and this type of workflow.
